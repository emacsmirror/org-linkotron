;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The purpose of this package is to provide a way to open a group of
;; org-links at once.  A group is defined as all org-links under a
;; heading/sub heading, no need to use any special layout or formatting.
;;
;; The motivation is that I usually have at least a couple of sites I need
;; to visit for any specific task, so opening them all at once saves me time.
;;
;; Links are opened via the standard org funktion ~org-open-at-point~.
;;
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Evaluate the elisp source file in some manner.  If you like quelpa,
;; this line would also work in your init.el:
;;
;;   (when (not (require 'org-linkotron nil 'noerror))
;;     (quelpa '(org-linkotron :repo "perweij/org-linkotron" :fetcher gitlab)))
;;   (require 'org-linkotron)
;;
;;
;;; Usage:
;;
;; In an org-file, create a heading with some links in the text
;; below, for example:
;;
;;  ** Some links about something
;;  Here is a text with two links, here: [[https://www.fsf.org/][fsf]] and
;;  here: [[https://fsfe.org/][fsfe]].
;;  A final one: [[https://www.gnu.org/][gnu]].
;;  ** Another interesting link collection
;;   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500][Amiga 500]]
;;   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64][Commodore 64]]
;;
;; Now, just place the cursor on the relevant header or its text, and
;; invoke
;; org-linkotron-open-group
;;
;;; Credits:
;;
;;  - Thanks to [[https://github.com/alphapapa][alphapapa]] for supplying an
;;    elegant implementation and great feedback.
;;    I also borrowed much of the project structure of his
;;    org-super-agenda project, as well as the test script
;;    [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]].
