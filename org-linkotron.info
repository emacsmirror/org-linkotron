1 Commentary:
*************

The purpose of this package is to provide a way to open a group of
org-links at once.  A group is defined as all org-links under a
heading/sub heading, no need to use any special layout or formatting.

   The motivation is that I usually have at least a couple of sites I
need to visit for any specific task, so opening them all at once saves
me time.

   Links are opened via the standard org funktion ‘org-open-at-point’.

2 Installation:
***************

Evaluate the elisp source file in some manner.  If you like quelpa, this
line would also work in your init.el:

     (when (not (require 'org-linkotron nil 'noerror))
       (quelpa '(org-linkotron :repo "perweij/org-linkotron" :fetcher gitlab)))
     (require 'org-linkotron)

3 Usage:
********

In an org-file, create a heading with some links in the text below, for
example:

     ** Some links about something
     Here is a text with two links, here: [[https://www.fsf.org/][fsf]] and
     here: [[https://fsfe.org/][fsfe]].
     A final one: [[https://www.gnu.org/][gnu]].
     ** Another interesting link collection
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500][Amiga 500]]
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64][Commodore 64]]

   Now, just place the cursor on the relevant header or its text, and
invoke
     org-linkotron-open-group

   • Thanks to alphapapa (https://github.com/alphapapa) for supplying an
     elegant implementation and great feedback.  I also borrowed much of
     the project structure of his org-super-agenda project, as well as
     the test script makem.sh (https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh).
